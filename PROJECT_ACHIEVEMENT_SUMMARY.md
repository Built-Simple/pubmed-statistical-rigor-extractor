## The Rigor Scoring System

### What We Measure
A comprehensive 100-point scoring system evaluating statistical completeness:

| Component | Points | What It Measures | Found In Dataset |
|-----------|--------|------------------|------------------|
| **P-values** | 30 | Statistical significance reporting | 74.3% of articles |
| **Confidence Intervals** | 20 | Precision of estimates | 1.7% of articles |
| **Effect Sizes** | 15 | Magnitude of findings | 12.8% of articles |
| **Sample Sizes** | 10 | Study scale and power | 52.1% of articles |
| **Statistical Tests** | 10 | Methodological transparency | 40.6% of articles |
| **Power Analysis** | 10 | Study design quality | 0.6% of articles |
| **Multiple Corrections** | 5 | False discovery control | 2.4% of articles |

### Statistical Patterns Extracted
Using advanced regex patterns, we capture:
- P-values in 15+ different formats (p<0.05, P=0.001, p-value: 0.023, etc.)
- Sample sizes from "n=10" to complex group descriptions
- Confidence intervals in various notations (95% CI: 1.2-3.4, [0.8, 2.1], etc.)
- Effect sizes (Cohen's d, η², R², odds ratios, hazard ratios)
- 50+ statistical test names (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, Mann-Whitney, etc.)
- Power calculations and multiple testing corrections

## Key Findings

### Overall Statistics
- **80.4%** of articles contain at least some statistical reporting
- **19.6%** have no detectable statistics (reviews, editorials, protocols)
- **Mean rigor score**: 39.08/100
- **Median rigor score**: 35/100
- Only **0.53%** achieve scores >90 (complete statistical reporting)

### Distribution Insights
```
Score Range | Articles    | Percentage | Cumulative
------------|-------------|------------|------------
0           | 836,876     | 19.57%     | 19.57%
1-30        | 979,968     | 22.92%     | 42.49%
31-50       | 853,677     | 19.96%     | 62.45%
51-70       | 1,092,881   | 25.56%     | 88.01%
71-100      | 512,526     | 11.99%     | 100.00%
```

### Quality Insights
- **High-quality reporting** (score >60): Perfect extraction accuracy
- **Medium-quality** (score 35-50): Near-perfect extraction
- **Low-quality** (score <30): ~50% completeness (statistics hidden in tables/figures)

---

## Validation Results

### Three-Tier Validation Study
Sampled 60 articles across score ranges to verify extraction accuracy:

1. **High Scores (60-100)**:
   - 100% extraction accuracy
   - All statistical values verified in original text
   - No false positives

2. **Medium Scores (35-50)**:
   - 100% extraction accuracy for detected items
   - 65% perfect extractions (nothing missed)
   - 35% had minor omissions (mostly CIs in text)

3. **Low Scores (1-30)**:
   - 50% completeness
   - Statistics often in tables, figures, or non-standard formats
   - Regex patterns miss graphical/tabular data
